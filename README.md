## Diversity and Abundance of Microbial Communities in Rhizospheric Soils from Smallholder Banana producing Agroecosystems in Kiambu, Kenya

Bananas are monocotyledonous plants in the genus Musa (Musaceae, zingiberals). They are multiplied clonally through suckers in the field or by in-vitro cultivation. Smallholder farmers form 85% of Banana production in Kenya. Banana production is directly affected by soil health, pests, and diseases. Soils are one of the most diverse habitats with approximately 4000 â€“ 50000 species per gram of soil. The rhizosphere is a dynamic zone of significant biotic and abiotic interactions between the soil-borne microbiome and plant roots. Soil parameters i.e. pH and organic matter influence microbial diversity. Most soil microbes are uncultivable hence less is known about their functional potential. High-throughput sequencing approaches enable genomic analyses of soil microbes. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing provides taxonomic composition and functional potential of soil microbiome.

### *The problem being solved by the research*

Banana farming is a major economic activity in Kenya, however, there is a decline in production due to factors such as soil health as well as pests and diseases. Numerous soil-borne diseases act as a limiting factor in banana production worldwide. Most farmers use conventional methods to control soil-borne pathogens i.e. pesticides, fungicides and antibacterial agents. The use of conventional methods has the potential to reduce soil microbial communities, hence lower yields.

### *Justification of the study*

This study will apply metagenomics approaches to reveal the soil microbial diversity and its functional potential. The application of high-throughput sequencing techniques will permit genomic analyses of all. Soil microbes enable profiling of their taxonomic composition and functional potential. Metagenomic techniques will aid in the development of sustainable tools in agriculture, hence improving microbiome structures as well as overall productivity.
