## Diversity and Abundance of Microbial Communities in Rhizospheric Soils from Smallholder Banana producing Agroecosystems in Kiambu, Kenya

Bananas are monocotyledonous plants in the genus Musa (Musaceae, zingiberals). They are multiplied clonally through suckers in the field or by in-vitro cultivation Smallholder farmers form 85% of Banana production in Kenya. Banana production is directly affected by soil health, pests, and diseases. Soils are one of the most diverse habitats with approximately 4000 â€“ 50000 species per gram of soil. The rhizosphere is a dynamic zone of significant biotic and abiotic interactions between the soil-borne microbiome and plant roots. Soil parameters i.e. pH and organic matter influence microbial diversity. Most soil microbes are uncultivable hence less is known about their functional potential High-throughput sequencing approaches enable genomic analyses of soil microbes Shotgun sequencing provides taxonomic composition and functional potential of soil microbiome.
