## Diversity and Abundance of Microbial Communities in Rhizospheric Soils from Smallholder Banana producing Agroecosystems in Kiambu, Kenya
#Background Information 
Bananas are monocotyledonous plants in the genus Musa (Musaceae, Zingiberales) (Heslop
Harrison & Schwarzacher, 2007). They are the fourth most important crop in developing countries, 
with a worldwide production of about 100 million tonnes.Banana farming is a major 
economic activity in Kenya (Muthee et al., 2019).Agwara (2017) reported that Embu County 
produces 12% of all bananas produced in Kenya and is ranked third after Meru (19%) and 
Kirinyaga (14%). Other banana producing counties in Kenya are Taita Taveta (9%), Muranga 
(7%), Kisii (6%), Tharaka Nithi (6%) and Bungoma (5%) (Muthee et al., 2019).
Biotic and abiotic causes have limited the production of bananas.Microbial 
metagenomics uses high-throughput sequencing technology to characterize the taxonomic and 
functional attributes of biological communities.This study aims at understanding the community structure andthe relative abundance of soil 
microbial communities in banana rhizosphere soils from banana-producing agroecosystems in 
Kiambu County, Kenya. Furthermore, the study will analyse the functional potential of the soil 
microbial communities as well as assess the association of the soil parameters with the dominant 
microbial taxa. Data from the metagenomic study of the soil microbial communities will help in 
innovating reliable tools in agriculture to improve soil microbiome structures as well as influence 
higher banana productivity in the agroecosystems.

### *The problem being solved by the research*

Banana farming is one of the major economic activities in Kenya practiced by small-scale farmers 
who form 85% of the banana producers (Wahome et al., 2023). However, there is a decline in 
production due to several factors such as soil health as well as pests and diseases hence banana 
producers do not meet the market demand. Soil productivity depends on its health and quality, 
hence microbial diversity in soil habitats is a key indicator of soil health and quality. Stressors that 
affect soil biodiversity such as human activities, the decline in soil organic matter and degradation 
of land has led to the loss of aboveground and below ground biodiversity. The decline in soil health 
and fertility including biological degradation (organic matter) in Kiambu County is a worrying 
trend and has the potential to lower productivity significantly. In addition, the accumulation of 
pathogenic microorganisms as primary inhabitants in the soil has become a main limiting factor in 
banana crop production greatly affecting the yield and fruit quality. This has led to most farmers 
using conventional methods in their control that mainly target soil pathogens using antibacterial 
agents, pesticides, and fungicides. As a result, there is a potential reduction of soil microbial 
communities. 
The culture-dependent approaches to identifying the soil microbes are failing to provide clear 
estimates of the microbial diversity and untapped resources (N. Sabale et al., 2020). Since most of 
the soil microbes are uncultivable (Kaushal et al., 2020), it has made it difficult to develop 
programs to uplift the yield levels even at the policy level. 

#### *Justification of the study*

Although, soil microorganisms play a crucial role in the establishment and maintenance of plant 
ecosystems, the vast majority of the rhizosphere's population remains uncharacterized and unknown. 
The evaluation of banana rhizospheric soil microbiome community structure and 
function using cutting-edge metagenomic approaches will open up new perspectives on the soil 
microbial life in the banana agroecosystems in Kiambu County. Additionally, soil metagenomics 
has the potential to increase agricultural output and unearth numerous as-yet-undiscovered soil 
microbes, their roles, and genes for a variety of applications. The genomic, metabolic, and 
phylogenetic diversity that is stored in the banana soil metagenomes will also be explored by 
shotgun metagenomic techniques. Studying soil microbial diversity in relation to soil 
physicochemical parameters within the respective agroecosystems will aid greatly in identifying 
factors affecting beneficial microbial communities, thus highlighting the need for adoption and 
development of tools for sustainable agricultural practice in banana production. 

##### Research questions 
i) How are soil microbial communities distributed in rhizosphere soils collected from banana 
growing agroecosystems in Kiambu County? 
ii) What is the functional potential of the microbial communities in rhizosphere soils collected 
from banana growing agroecosystems in Kiambu County? 
iii) What is the correlation between the rhizospheric soil microbes and soil parameters in banana 
growing agroecosystems in Kiambu County?
